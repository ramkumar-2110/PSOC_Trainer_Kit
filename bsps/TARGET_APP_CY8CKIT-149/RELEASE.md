### CY8CKIT-149 BSP
The PSOC™ 4100S Plus Prototyping Kit enables you to evaluate the PSOC™ 4100S Plus device and develop with Cypress's fourth-generation, low-power CAPSENSE™ solution.

NOTE: BSPs are versioned by family. This means that version 1.2.0 of any BSP in a family (eg: PSOC&trade; 6) will have the same software maturity level. However, not all updates are necessarily applicable for each BSP in the family so not all version numbers will exist for each board. Additionally, new BSPs may not start at version 1.0.0. In the event of adding a common feature across all BSPs, the libraries are assigned the same version number. For example if BSP_A is at v1.3.0 and BSP_B is at v1.2.0, the event will trigger a version update to v1.4.0 for both BSP_A and BSP_B. This allows the common feature to be tracked in a consistent way.

### What's Included?
The CY8CKIT-149 library includes the following:
* BSP specific makefile to configure the build process for the board
* cybsp.c/h files to initialize the board and any system peripherals
* cybsp_types.h file describing basic board setup
* Linker script & startup code for GCC, IAR, and ARM toolchains
* Configurator design files (and generated code) to setup board specific peripherals
* .lib file references for all dependent libraries
* API documentation
